# PROJECT: HOUSE OF THE DOCKERS
#STEP 1: Install Docker and start 
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum upgrade -y
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
docker -v

#  STEP 2: Create File Structure 
mkdir -p ~/Docker-files/{Docker1,Docker2,Docker3}
cd ~/Docker-files

#STEP 3: Create Text Files and paste content
#Docker1 files
cd Docker1
echo "Atticus said to Jem one day, I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you’ll go after birds.Shoot all the blue jays you want, 
if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird." > Aviana.txt
echo "That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it." > Bryant.txt
echo "Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy." > Kyron.txt
echo "They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. " > Rowland.txt
echo "That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird." > Suhayb.txt

echo "The most important things are the hardest to say. They are the things you get ashamed of, because words diminish them — 
words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they’re brought out." > Aaisha.txt
echo "But it’s more than that, isn’t it?" > Aleah.txt
echo "The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away." > Arnold.txt
echo "And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you’ve said at all, 
or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it." > Hall.txt
echo "That’s the worst, I think." > Rhea.txt
echo "When the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear." > Skinner.txt

echo "Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. 
You turn again, but the storm adjusts.Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn." > Chan.txt
echo "Why? Because this storm isn’t something that blew in from far away, 
something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you.Something inside of you. " > Costa.txt
echo "So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, 
closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn’t get in, and walk through it, step by step." > Cydney.txt
echo "There’s no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. 
That’s the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine." > Frederick.txt
echo "And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be,
make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades." > Hampton.txt
echo "People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. 
You’ll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others." > Jane.txt
echo "And once the storm is over you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. 
You won’t even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over." > Luna.txt
echo "But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won’t be the same person who walked in. 
That’s what this storm’s all about." > Yassin.txt
