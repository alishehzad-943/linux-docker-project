# PROJECT: HOUSE OF THE DOCKERS
#STEP 1: Install Docker and start 
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum upgrade -y
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
docker -v

#  STEP 2: Create File Structure 
mkdir -p ~/Docker-files/{Docker1,Docker2,Docker3}
cd ~/Docker-files

#STEP 3: Create Text Files and paste content
#Docker1 files
cd Docker1
echo "Atticus said to Jem one day, I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you’ll go after birds.Shoot all the blue jays you want,
if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird." > Aviana.txt
echo "That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it." > Bryant.txt
echo "Your father’s right, she said. Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy." > Kyron.txt
echo "They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us." > Rowland.txt
echo "That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird." > Suhayb.txt

#  Docker2 files
cd ../Docker2
echo "The most important things are the hardest to say. They are the things you get ashamed of, because words diminish them." > Aaisha.txt
echo "But it’s more than that, isn’t it?" > Aleah.txt
echo "The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried." > Arnold.txt
echo "And you may make revelations that cost you dearly." > Hall.txt
echo "That’s the worst, I think." > Rhea.txt
echo "When the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear." > Skinner.txt

# Docker3 files
cd ../Docker3
echo "Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions." > Chan.txt
echo "Why? Because this storm isn’t something that blew in from far away." > Costa.txt
echo "So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm." > Cydney.txt
echo "There’s no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time." > Frederick.txt
echo "You really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical storm." > Hampton.txt
echo "People will bleed there, and you will bleed too." > Jane.txt
echo "Once the storm is over you won’t remember how you made it through." > Luna.txt
echo "When you come out of the storm you won’t be the same person who walked in." > Yassin.txt

#STEP 4: Build Docker Custom Image through Dockerfile
cd ~/Docker-files
echo "FROM ubuntu
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app" > Dockerfile
sudo docker build -t my-image .

#STEP 5: Run three Containers
sudo docker run -dit --name container1 -v $(pwd)/Docker1:/app my-image bash
sudo docker run -dit --name container2 -v $(pwd)/Docker2:/app my-image bash
sudo docker run -dit --name container3 -v $(pwd)/Docker3:/app my-image bash

#STEP 6: Scheduling Simulation 
# FCFS – Container1 (No sorting)
echo "FCFS (Container1)"
sudo docker exec container1 bash -c "ls -l /app"

# SJN – Container2 (Sort by file size)
echo "SJN (Container2) "
sudo docker exec container2 bash -c "ls -l /app | sort -k5n"

# SJN – Container3 (Sort by file size)
echo " (Container3)"
sudo docker exec container3 bash -c "ls /app | sort  -k5n"

# STEP 7: Merging files in HOUSE_OF_THE_DOCKERS 
cd ~/Docker-files
touch HOUSE_OF_THE_DOCKERS.txt

# Combine files in FCFS order (Docker1)
cat Docker1/Aviana.txt Docker1/Bryant.txt >> HOUSE_OF_THE_DOCKERS.txt

# Combine shortest files first (Docker2)
cat $(ls -S Docker2 | head -n 3 | xargs -I{} echo Docker2/{}) >> HOUSE_OF_THE_DOCKERS.txt

# Combine few from Docker3 (Round Robin style)
cat $(ls Docker3 | sort | head -n 3 | xargs -I{} echo Docker3/{}) >> HOUSE_OF_THE_DOCKERS.txt

# ROUND 2 
cat Docker1/Kyron.txt Docker1/Rowland.txt >> HOUSE_OF_THE_DOCKERS.txt
cat $(ls -S Docker2 | sed -n '3,4p' | xargs -I{} echo Docker2/{}) >> HOUSE_OF_THE_DOCKERS.txt
cat $(ls -S Docker3 | sed -n '3,4p' | xargs -I{} echo Docker3/{}) >> HOUSE_OF_THE_DOCKERS.txt

# ROUND 3
cat Docker1/Suhayb.txt >> HOUSE_OF_THE_DOCKERS.txt
cat $(ls -S Docker2 | sed -n '5,6p' | xargs -I{} echo Docker2/{}) >> HOUSE_OF_THE_DOCKERS.txt
cat $(ls -S Docker3 | sed -n '5,8p' | xargs -I{} echo Docker3/{}) >> HOUSE_OF_THE_DOCKERS.txt


echo "FINAL OUTPUT"
cat HOUSE_OF_THE_DOCKERS.txt
